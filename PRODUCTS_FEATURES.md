The products page has been enhanced to show all products added by different users with dynamic "New Product" badges and additional information.

- Badge is prominently displayed with orange gradient and shadow effects

### 3. Product Information Display
- **Location**: Shows city, state, and country information
- **Condition**: Displays product condition (new, used, etc.)
- **Creation Date**: Shows when the product was added (e.g., "Added today", "Added 3 days ago")
- **User Information**: Tracks which user added each product

### 4. Enhanced UI Features
- **New Products Counter**: Shows count of new products available
- **Manual Refresh Button**: Allows users to manually refresh the product list

badgeClass: daysDifference < 2 ? 'new' : null,
```
